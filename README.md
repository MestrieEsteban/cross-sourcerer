### = Prelude

Well, as a developer we all use Github ; But is there a way to have visual informations of public users informations and meta-data ?
Yes ! Thanks to Github API we can have any data we want, and the goal of the project is to make a copycat of.... [**Sourcerer**](https://sourcerer.io/) !

The website first usecase is to simply consume Github API to display data.

You **MUST** do the same by using **GraphQL Github API** available [here](https://developer.github.com/v4/)

The purpose here is to share maxium possible code from all clients (and server of course in case of bonuses ;p)

### = Features

Take a look at the screen below ;<br />
Everything in red is **MANDATORY** and **ROSE** is optionnal

* Add more visual effect #css4TheWin 🎉
